This paper explores a novel structure for a course, which we call ``Multi-Semester, Multi-Cohort". The course structure is framed around a long-term goal across multiple semesters, with a different groups of students each semester. We know that the goal is sufficiently challenging that it will take more than one semester to achieve. As a result, the students working on the project will be different every semester. While this model can be used in a variety of applied disciplines, the course in this instance is in Robotics. This model has some very interesting benefits but raises unique challenges. Our experience using this with a course called the ``Autonomous Robotics Lab'' covers two completed semesters and one about to begin. In this paper we will explain our motivation for using this structure, details of the curriculum and pedagogical approach to it, including admission criteria, course schedule, scaffolding, assessment and report on our experiences, including what went well and what we need to improve.
