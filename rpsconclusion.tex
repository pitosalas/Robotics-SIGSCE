\section{Conclusion}
This paper described an extension to ``project-based learning''\cite{projects} which we have called Multi-Semester Multi-Cohort. We report in detail what our goals are, and how we mapped those goals into a course design. In our case, the context has been a Robotics Lab course, which has been offered for two semesters and has just begun a third semester. In the paper we go into detail on those decisions that worked well and those that worked less well. Our hope and intention is that others might use some of the lessons we learned in applying this or a similar approach in the future, in Robotics, Computer Science or other disciplines.
