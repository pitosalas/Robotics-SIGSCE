abstract = {When an introductory course on software design and testing was revised, it was decided to use open source software tools as the major examples and objects of study. The goal was to expose students to realistic software systems and give them experience dealing with large quantities of code written by other people. Using open source software also has the beneficial effect of ensuring that students are aware of the open source software movement, and opens up opportunities to discuss topics such as software piracy and ethics.},

abstract = {Companies that enjoy enduring success have a core purpose and core values that remain fixed while their strategies and practices endlessly adapt to a changing world. The rare ability to balance continuity and change-requiring a consciously practiced discipline-is closely linked to the ability to develop a vision. Vision provides guidance about what to preserve and what to change. A new prescriptive framework adds clarity and rigor to the vague and fuzzy vision concepts at large today. The framework has two principal parts: core ideology and envisioned future. Core ideology combines an organization's core values and core purpose. It's the glue that holds a company together as it grows and changes. Core values are an organization's essential and enduring tenets-the values it would hold even if they became a competitive disadvantage; core purpose is the organization's fundamental reason for being. The second component of the vision framework is the envisioned future. First, a company must identify bold stretch goals; then it should articulate vivid descriptions of what it will mean to achieve them. Henry Ford set the goal of democratizing the automobile, then told the world, "When I'm through...everyone will have one. The horse will have disappeared from our highways"-an imaginative stretch for the time. Unfortunately, the usual vision statement is fuzzy and inspires only boredom. But managers who master a discovery process to identify core ideology can link their vision statements to the fundamental dynamic that motivates truly visionary companies-that is, the dynamic of preserving the core and stimulating progress. INSETS: Core values are a company's essential tenets (examples);Core purpose is a company's reason for being (examples);Big, hairy, audacious goals aid long-term vision (examples);Putting it all together: Sony in the 1950s ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER Harvard Business Review Notice of Use Restrictions, May 2009Harvard Business Review and Harvard Business Publishing Newsletter content on EBSCOhost is licensed for the private individual use of authorized EBSCOhost users.

abstract = {–In this paper we describe the EPICS Program at Purdue that was started in 1995 and has evolved into a multidisciplinary academic program engaging more than 800 students per year from nearly 70 disciplines across and outside of engineering. EPICS has been disseminated to other campuses and has been adopted as a K12 approach for introducing engineering through community engagement. This paper describes the current program and shares best practices and lessons learned as the program developed to provide insight for faculty and administrators seeking to develop service-learning, learning through service-learning, or community-based engineering. Data from the program related to student learning and community impact is shared. A discussion of the characteristics to make dissemination successful is also discussed.},

@article{VIP,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Society for Engineering Education. A survey of papers in the ASEE Multidisciplinary Engineering Division for the last three years shows three main areas of emphasis: individual courses; profiles of specific projects; and capstone design courses. However, multidisciplinary education across all disciplines requires a larger-scale model that can be incorporated into any discipline, a model that is both cost effective and scalable, and one that fully engages and benefits faculty. A consortium of 19 US and 5 international institutions has come together around such a model, the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program. VIP unites undergraduate education and faculty research in a teambased context, with students earning academic credits toward their degre es, and faculty and graduate students benefitting from the design/discovery efforts of their multidisciplinary teams. VIP is novel because it unites rich student learning experiences with faculty research, transforming both the context of undergraduate education and the concept of faculty research as a separate endeavor. It provides a cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable model for multidisciplinary project-based learning: students earn academic credit instead of stipends; typical teams consist of fifteen or more students from different disciplines; students participate multiple years as they progress through their curriculum; and faculty benefit from the research and design efforts of their teams, with teams becoming integral parts of their research. While VIP programs share key elements, approaches and implementations vary by institution. This paper presents: an overview of the VIP Consortium; the multidisciplinary nature of the program within and across institutions; and profiles of 4 international institutions and their implementations of the model. The profiled institutions are based in Colombia, Korea, Latvia, and Scotland.},
